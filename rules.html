GAME RULES:<p>- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds<br>
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score<br>
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn<br>
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn<br>
- The first player to reach 50 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.<br> Note: The image below says the end score is 100 but I changed it to 50 to make the game shorter.</p>
